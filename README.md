1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation.
2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.
3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.
4. In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain.
5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain
6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?


(1) One problom I encountered in this unit was finding out the solutions to my problems that were in my code, and I had to ask the teacher everytime i had a problem to be able to fix it.
(2) My understanding changed alot, now with what I have seen and with what I have worked with I can now kindof understand how other websites work and how they did it (BUT NOT SO MUCH). Also I deffenetly feel like my skills improved alot since the beginning of the semester.
(3) A new skill that I have acquired is coding, before I was only able to code using just very simple websites and programs, but now I feel like I can do coding on a new level.
(4) Computers can improve our lives by making comunicaation esiar, and having research and and coding and gives us the ability to experience things in a deffernt way.
(5) Our lives can improve by making depretion rates and loneleness decrease, and their would be less destraction in the world.
(6) Amm Yeah I think so, it can impact my future because maybe I will become computer expert and I will be able to make websites or games of my own, and with that I will be able to make money maybe.
